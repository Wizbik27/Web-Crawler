Developed a modern GUI for a web crawler using Python Tkinter:

Objective: Create a user-friendly interface for users to input URLs, set crawling parameters, and view results.
Features:
Input fields for URLs and crawling parameters (e.g., depth, keywords).
Buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the crawler.
Display area for showing the crawled URLs and extracted data.
Design: Used Tkinter widgets such as Entry, Button, Label, and Text to build the GUI layout, ensuring it is intuitive and easy to navigate.
Implemented threading for smooth operation during website crawling:

Objective: Ensure the GUI remains responsive while the crawler runs in the background.
Approach:
Used Python's threading module to run the crawling process in a separate thread.
Ensured the main thread handles the GUI operations, preventing it from freezing or becoming unresponsive during the crawling.
Implementation: Created a worker thread for the crawling logic, ensuring thread-safe operations using locks or queues where necessary.
Provided live updates on crawling progress within the GUI:

Objective: Keep users informed about the crawling progress in real-time.
Features:
Progress bar to visually represent the crawling progress.
Real-time updates of the number of URLs crawled and the data extracted.
Status messages to inform users about the current state of the crawler (e.g., "Crawling in progress", "Crawling paused", "Crawling completed").
Implementation: Used Tkinter's after method to periodically update the GUI with the latest progress information from the crawling thread.
Integrated error handling to manage unexpected issues such as network errors and parsing exceptions during the crawling process:

Objective: Ensure the crawler can handle and recover from errors gracefully without crashing.
Approach:
Implemented try-except blocks around network requests and parsing operations.
Logged errors to a file or displayed them in the GUI for user awareness.
Implemented retry mechanisms for transient network issues and skipped problematic URLs after a certain number of retries.
Result: Enhanced robustness of the crawler, improving user experience and reliability.
Enhanced usability features, including user-friendly start/stop buttons, status indicators, and the ability to save crawled data to a file for later analysis:

Objective: Improve the overall usability and functionality of the GUI.
Features:
Start/Stop buttons to control the crawling process.
Status indicators to show whether the crawler is running, paused, or stopped.
Save functionality to allow users to export the crawled data into a CSV or JSON file for further analysis.
Implementation:
Added start/stop button functionality using Tkinter's command bindings.
Used status labels or icons to visually indicate the crawler's state.
Implemented file-saving logic to export data, ensuring proper file handling and user feedback on successful/failed saves.
Technologies used: Python, Tkinter, Requests, BeautifulSoup:

Python: Core programming language used for developing the application.
Tkinter: Used for building the graphical user interface.
Requests: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
BeautifulSoup: Used for parsing HTML content and extracting relevant data from web pages.
